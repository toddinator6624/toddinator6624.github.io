       <p> Hello my name is <strong>Todd Larkin</strong>, and I am a senior in high school. I am originally from Northeast Gerogia where I grew up until I was 16. I recently moved to Magee, Mississippi in January. I will go into more detail about how that all came about later on my blog. I want to thank you for taking the time out of your day to look at my blog. I am about to share just a little bit about what makes me who I am and how I have come to be so.</p>
       
       <h2 id="Basketball"> Basketball</h2>

       <p>One of the passions in my life is the game of basketball. I started playing the game when I was <strong>seven years old</strong> and ever since I have grown more in love with the game. I started to train and take the game seriously when I was <strong>thirteen</strong> because it was at that age that I discovered my aspirations to play at the next level.<strong>The summer going into my 8th grade year</strong> I attended this basketball camp and the organizations name was PGC basketball. I was excited to go because this was goimg to be my first time going to an overnight camp away from my family. I had no idea at the time what great things would come from that one week. I began to go to several camps each summer since thanks to my parents investment in the business's lifetime pass.</p>
       
    <h2 id="Faith"> Faith</h2>

    <p>I am a follower of Christ. I realize I am not perfect by any means;however, I choose to learn from my mistakes and grow in my relationship with God. I love being a Christian because of how much joy being a Christian brings into my life. It is comforting knowing that God is so righteous that he gave his son so that my sins may be forgiven. Being a Christian does not mean every aspect of my life will always be ok, I have learned that when adversity comes my way I need to have <strong>Faith</strong> in God and his plan for my life. Having <strong>Faith</strong> is one of the if not the most important characteristic of being a follower of christianity. I look forwrad to one day being in ministry so that I may pour into the hearts of the next generation of Christians through the power of God's word.</p>
        
<h2 id="Journey"> Journey</h2>
<p>The journey I have taken in life is one that I would not trade for anything. No it has not been amazing every second; however, it is thanks to every experience that I am where I am today. I have met several mentors who hav shaped my life for the better that I wish everyone got the chance to meet. Through basketball, my walk with God, and through my travels I have met amazing individuals. I have experienced traveling outside of the country, an experience that some people may never get the privilege of doing. I've been given opportunities to speak to groups of people about my faith and share the word of God. Starting this summer I will start my basketball instructing career thanks to PGC basketball. The adversity that has hit me time and time again has a purpose. It is thanks to that adversity that I can get outside of my comfort zone and grow. I encourage everyone to strive to better themselves and ultimately embrace their journey!</p>
