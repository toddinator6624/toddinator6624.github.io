       <p> Hello my name is <strong>Todd Larkin</strong>, and I am a senior in high school. I am originally from Northeast Gerogia where I grew up until I was 16. I recently moved to Magee, Mississippi in January. I will go into more detail about how that all came about later on my blog. I want to thank you for taking the time out of your day to look at my blog. I am about to share just a little bit about what makes me who I am and how I have come to be so.</p>

       <p>One of the passions in my life is the game of basketball. I started playing the game when I was <strong>seven years old</strong> and ever since I have grown more in love with the game. I started to train and take the game seriously when I was <strong>thirteen</strong> because it was at that age that I discovered my aspirations to play at the next level.<strong>The summer going into my 8th grade year</strong> I attended this basketball camp and the organizations name was PGC basketball. I was excited to go because this was goimg to be my first time going to an overnight camp away from my family. I had no idea at the time what great things would come from that one week. I began to go to several camps each summer since thanks to my parents investment in the business's lifetime pass.</p>
